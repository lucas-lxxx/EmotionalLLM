 someone you trust, even if just to share how you feel. Focus on one thing you can control, like sipping water or stepping outside for fresh air. Progress isn’t about fixing everything at once—it’s about choosing one moment to shift. You’ve weathered tough times before, and this is no different. Be gentle with yourself.
