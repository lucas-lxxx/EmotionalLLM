# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Type

This is a scientific research project (not a code repository). The subject is adversarial attacks on Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) targeting emotion recognition.

## Key File

**Read `CONTEXT.md` first.** It contains mandatory collaboration rules (Part 1), research background and findings (Part 2), and the current execution plan (Part 3). All AI interactions in this project must follow the requirements defined there.

## Structure

- `CONTEXT.md` — AI collaboration guide (rules + research snapshot + plan)
- `LATEST/` — Current progress: PPT scripts, meeting transcripts, experiment materials
- `LATEST/white_box_final/` — White-box attack 4-stage experiment data and presentations
- `paper/` — Reference papers (~20)
- `框架.png` — Paper outline diagram
- `PREVIOUS/` — Archived early explorations (generally not relevant)

## Language

Default working language is Chinese. Use LaTeX for math formulas.

## Installed Skills

- `pdf-processing-pro` — PDF processing with OCR and table extraction
- `pptx` — PowerPoint creation and editing
